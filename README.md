# Bookings - Spring Boot

This is a sample Spring Boot microservice. It depends on a database for managing the bookings.

Three environment variables are expected:
 - `DB_URL` - The JDBC URL for the database
 - `DB_USER` - The database user name
 - `DB_PW` - The database password

The code has been tested with both Postgres and H2
